# Introduction: 
  Students use ride services for traveling to and from the UCSD campus. Most services like Uber and Lyft become incredibly expensive as the distance of travel increases -- so students post on the UCSD Facebook Page to offer and request rides. However, these tickets quickly become buried under piles of other tickets not related to the rides as well as remain on the page long after the ride is over. To address this issue, our web based application Ride+ will offer the same functionality. Ride+ will provide a web platform for UCSD students who want to subsidize their travel expenses and also to those who want to enjoy safe rides from other UCSD students.
